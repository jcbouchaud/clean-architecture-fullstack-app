# Clean Architecture
- Be as functional as possible

## Project Structure
- Organize code into distinct layers following clean architecture principles:
  - `app/`: Next.js pages and route-specific components (Presentation Layer)
  - `src/`: Core business logic and infrastructure
    - `application/`: Use cases, interfaces, and application services
    - `infrastructure/`: External services, databases, and frameworks
    - `entities/`: Business objects and domain models
    - `controllers/`: Business logic controllers
  - `lib/`: Utilities and shared helpers

## Layer Responsibilities

### Presentation Layer (app/)
- Handles UI and user interaction
- Contains Next.js pages and components
- Communicates with controllers for business logic
- Place in `app/` directory:
  - `page.tsx`: Route pages
  - `layout.tsx`: Layout components
  - `components/`: Route-specific components

### Application Layer (src/application/)
- Implements use cases and defines interfaces
- Depends only on domain layer
- Place in `src/application/` directory:
  - `use-cases/`: Business use cases
  - `repositories/`: Repository interfaces
  - `services/`: Service interfaces

### Infrastructure Layer (src/infrastructure/)
- Implements interfaces defined in application layer
- Handles external dependencies
- Place in `src/infrastructure/` directory:
  - `repositories/`: Repository implementations and mock implementations
  - `services/`: External service implementations and mock implementations
  - `database/`: Database configurations

### Domain Layer (src/entities/)
- Contains business entities and core business rules
- Should be framework and technology agnostic
- Place in `src/entities/` directory:
  - `models/`: Business objects and domain models
  - `errors/`: Domain-specific errors and exceptions

### Controllers Layer (src/controllers/)
- Orchestrates business logic between layers
- Handles request/response flow
- Coordinates between presentation and business logic
- Place in `src/controllers/` directory:
  - Business logic controllers

## Dependency Rules
- Inner layers cannot depend on outer layers
- Domain layer (entities) has no external dependencies
- Application layer depends only on domain layer
- Infrastructure layer implements application layer interfaces
- Controllers can depend on application and infrastructure
- Presentation layer (app/) can depend on controllers

## Best Practices
- Use dependency injection for better testability
- Implement interfaces for all external dependencies
- Keep business logic in application and controllers layers
- Use TypeScript for better type safety
- Follow SOLID principles
- Implement proper error handling at each layer
- Use Zod for input validation in controllers
- Keep components pure and focused

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for domain and application layers
- Integration tests for infrastructure layer
- E2E tests for presentation layer
- Use proper mocking for external dependencies
- Test business rules independently of framework

## State Management
- Keep state management close to where it's used
- Implement proper loading states
- Handle errors appropriately at each layer
- Use appropriate state management patterns for each layer

## Data Flow
- Data should flow from outer layers to inner layers
- Use Zod schemas for data validation at controller boundaries
- Handle errors and edge cases appropriately
- Use proper caching strategies

## Code Organization
- Use feature-based organization within layers
- Keep related code together
- Use proper naming conventions
- Document interfaces and public APIs
- Keep files focused and small
